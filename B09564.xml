            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVHereas we finde in the Examples of holy Scripture, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates have not onely excited and commanded all the people under their Government, <hi>to ſeek the Lord God of their Fathers, and do the Law and Commandment,</hi> 2 Chron. 14.2, 3, 4. Ezra 7.25, 26, 27. but alſo ſtirred up and ſent forth the Levites, accompanied with other principal men, <hi>to teach the good knowledge of the Lord throughout all the Cities of Judah,</hi> 2 Chron. 17.6, 7, 8, 9. which endeavours have been crowned with Gods bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Alſo we finde that our Brethren of the Congregational Perſwaſion in <hi>England</hi> have made a good Profeſſion, in their Book, intituled, <hi>A Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their Faith and Order,</hi> Pag. 59. Sect. 14. where they ſay, <hi>That although Paſtors and Teachers ſtand eſpecially related unto their particular Churches; yet they ought not to neglect others living within their Parochial Bounds, but beſides their conſtant publick Preaching to them, they ought to enquire after their profiting by the Word, inſtructing them in, and preſſing upon them (whether young or old) the great Doctrines of the Goſpel, even per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally and particularly, ſo farre as their ſtrength and time will permit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We hope that ſundry of you need not a ſpur in theſe things, but are conſcientiouſly careful to do your duty: yet foraſmuch as we have cauſe to fear, that there is too much neglect in many places, notwithſtanding the Laws long ſince provided therein; We do therefore think it our duty to emit this Declaration unto you, earneſtly deſiring, and in the bowels of our Lord Jeſus requiring you to be very diligent and careful to Catechize and Inſtruct all the people (eſpecially the Youth) under your Charge, in the Sound and Orthodox Principles of Chriſtian Religion; and that not onely in publick, but privately from houſe to houſe, as bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.20. or at leaſt three, four, or more Families meeting together, as ſtrength and time may permit, taking to your aſſiſtance ſuch godly and grave perſons as to you may ſeem moſt expedient. And alſo that you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to inform your ſelves, (as much as may be meet) how your Hearers do profit by the Word of God, and how their Converſations do agree therewith; and whether the Youth are taught to Reade the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue: taking all occaſions to apply ſuitable <hi>Exhortations</hi> particularly unto them, for the Rebuke of thoſe that do evil, and for the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them that do well.</p>
            <p>The effectual and conſtant proſecution hereof, we hope will have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to promote the Salvation of Souls, To ſuppreſs the growth of Sin and Prophaneneſs, To beget more Love and Unity amongſt the people, and more Reverence and Eſteem of the Miniſtry, and will aſſuredly be to the enlargement of your Crown and Recompence in Eternal Glory.</p>
